Why Go?
    1. Easy Concurrency
    2. Easy Unit Testing
    3. Compiled

    1. Simplicity
        25 keywords
        - No access modifiers
        - No exceptions (ONLY Errors)
        - No classes (ONLY structs & functions)
        - No inheritance (ONLY composition)

    2. Ease of Concurrency
        - Built for concurrency
            Builtin Scheduler
            1000s of goroutines can be scheduled in 1 OS thread
            Language features
                go, chan, <- channel operator, select, range

    3. Tooling support
        compiler
            1 executable
                Go scheduler + Garbage Collector
        package management

Tools
    1. Visual Studio Code (http://code.visualstudio.com/)
    2. Go tools (http://www.golang.org)

Data Types in Go
    bool
    string

    int
    int8
    int16
    int32
    int64

    uint
    uint8
    uint16
    uint32
    uint64

    float32
    float64

    complex64(real float32 + imaginary float32)
    complex128(real float64 + imaginary float64)

    byte(alias for uint8)
    rune(alias for int32) (represents Unicode code point (unicode character))

Programming constructs
    if
    switch
    for

functions
    1. variadic functions
    2. Higher order functions
        a. functions can be assigned to variables
        b. functions can be passed as arguments to other functions
        c. functions can be returned by other functions
    3. Closures
    4. deferred functions

panic and recover
    panic
        the application cannot proceed further
    recover
        - used to handle errors

complex types
    1. Array
        A fixed size collection of values of the same type
    2. Slice
    3. Map
